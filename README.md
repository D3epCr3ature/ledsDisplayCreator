## Background

After reproducing the star from Ludens by Bring Me The Horizon, I was struck by the issue of not being able to develop animations on it without having the actual hardware.

This is how I came with the idea of creating this tool that allows to create a LEDs display and communicate with it to create animations, before exporting them to the real deal.
